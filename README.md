# Alexa Asteroid Tracker

- Use this application to learn how to build Java powered Alexa Skills that connect to an outside API and expose them to voice control through an Amazon Voice Services enabled device.
-  A tutorial will be added to the wiki explaining how this was created and how each piece works together in the project.

## API Information

"NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) is a RESTful web service for near earth Asteroid information. With NeoWs a user can: search for Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth, lookup a specific Asteroid with its NASA JPL small body id, as well as browse the overall data-set.

Data-set: All the data is from the NASA JPL Asteroid team (http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/).

This API is maintained by SpaceRocks Team: David Greenfield, Arezu Sarvestani, Jason English and Peter Baunach."
